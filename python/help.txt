Usage: cut [OPTION]...
Cut video into marker sequences. The result is a bunch of files
with particular file pattern containing the marker name. If no
marker is assigned to a subclip it's treated as 'main'.

  -r, --ranges <file>           Specify the ranges file path.
  -i, --input <file>            Specify the input file path
  -o, --output <pattern>        Specify the output file pattern.
                                If contains '{}', then '{}' will be
                                replaced with the marker name.
  -f, --fontsize <int>          Specify the font size in px.
  -c, --collect <marker name>   Specify the name of the marker
                                sequence that should collect all
                                subclips. Tip: it's handy to
                                specify 'main' if you want 'main'
                                to not only be the sequence of
                                unassigned clips but also to
                                include every other.
 -h, --help                     You got it.
